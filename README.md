# Stock Prediction Project

This project uses AI and machine learning to predict stock prices and provide actionable buy/sell recommendations. It leverages historical data from Yahoo Finance, technical indicators, and machine learning models—including RandomForest and XGBoost—to analyze stocks over a multi-day horizon. Additional features such as volatility and momentum are incorporated to refine predictions and compute risk-adjusted returns.

This is just for fun and my own learning.....it is probably wrong so do not take advice from it!

## Directory Structure

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed stock data.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and prototyping.
- **src/**: Source code organized into:
  - **data/**: Data fetching and preprocessing modules.
    - `data_fetcher.py`: Downloads stock data using yfinance.
    - `preprocessing.py`: Cleans data and generates features (technical indicators, lag features, volatility, and momentum).
  - **models/**: Model training modules.
    - `random_forest.py`: Trains a RandomForest model.
    - `xgboost_model.py`: Trains an XGBoost model.
    - `lstm.py`: Builds and trains an LSTM network (optional).
  - **utils/**: Utility functions.
    - `visualization.py`: Contains functions for plotting predictions.
  - `main.py`: Main script for running an end-to-end pipeline for a single stock.
  - `market_scanner_live.py`: Scans the market, ranks stocks by predicted and risk-adjusted returns, and provides recommendations.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests.
- **market_tickers.csv**: A CSV file with a list of stock tickers (with a column named "Ticker").
- **requirements.txt**: Project dependencies.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd stock_prediction_project
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

    On Windows:
    ```bash
    py -3.11 -m venv env
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    python3.11 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Prepare Data**

    Place your market_tickers.csv file (which should include a column named "Ticker") in the project root (or in a designated data folder).

5. **Run the Project**
    **Single Stock Prediction:**  
    Run the main script for a single stock:

    ```bash
    python -m src.main
    ```

    **Market Scanning and Buy Advice:**  
    Run the market scanner to analyze and rank multiple stocks:

    ```bash
    python -m src.market_scanner_live
    ```

## Usage and Customization

**Model Selection:**  
Switch between RandomForest and XGBoost models by setting the `model_type` parameter in `market_scanner_live.py`.

**Target Horizon:**  
The project currently predicts a multi-day return (default is 5 days). You can adjust the horizon by modifying the `horizon` parameter in the `create_features_targets` function in `src/data/preprocessing.py`.

**Feature Engineering:**  
The preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI)
- Lag features
- Volatility (rolling standard deviation)
- Momentum (percentage change over a set period)

Feel free to add or modify features to better suit your strategy.

**Risk-Adjusted Returns:**  
The market scanner computes a risk-adjusted return (predicted return divided by historical volatility) to help rank stocks on a risk-adjusted basis.

**Visualization:**  
Plotting functions are available in `src/utils/visualization.py`. You can customize how results are displayed or save plots to files if preferred.

## Testing

To run unit tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
